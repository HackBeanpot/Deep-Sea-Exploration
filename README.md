# Exercises

## It is helpful to "fuzzy file search" (command shift F in VSCode) for "exercise __" in your repository

fuzzy file search = find a word in all of the files in your repository

### Exercise 1: 
In the Checklist.js file:

Add your name where it says "[Insert Name] Packing List"

### Exercise 2:
In the Checklist.js file:

Make sure the checkList is apart of the state. Hint: use the useState hook

### Exercise 3:
In Checklist.js file:

Enable the Clear All button to clear all items from the list

### Exercise 4:
In the Checklist.js file:

Enable the Add Item button to add items to the checkList

### Exercise 5:
Allow the "Send Message to Message Component" button to display the message typed in the Checklist component in the Message component. 

Hint: put relevant state and state "setters" to the parent of both components and pass down needed state and state "setters" down to the respective components.
